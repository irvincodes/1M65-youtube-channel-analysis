I began my journey learning more about Data Analytics around 1.5 months ago and started on a DA course recently. The purpose of this project is an attempt to do a simple yet complete first project and it's adapted from an online tutorial.

1M65 is one of the YouTube channels I follow and it was an interesting project to work on. I got to discover the channel statistics and also had some surprising discoveries along the way. It served as a good practice to learn more about the different Python libraries available and a good exercise to reinforce some of the syntax and concepts I've learned.

This mini project pushed me to read some documentation online and there was some use of LLM platforms for troubleshooting. Feel free to take a look at the Jupyter Notebook in this repo for more details!
