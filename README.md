# 1M65-youtube-channel-analysis

I have just started learning more about Data Analytics around 1.5 months ago and started on a DA course recently. The purpose of this project is an attempt to do a simple yet complete first project and was adapted from an online tutorial.

1M65 is one of the YouTube channels I follow and it was an interesting project to work on, to discover more about the channel statistics and I also had some surprising discoveries along the way. It was a good practice to learn more about the different Python libraries available and a good exercise to reinforce some of the syntax and concepts learned.

This mini project forced me to read some documentation online and I also made use of LLM platforms sometimes for troubleshooting. Feel free to take a look at the Jupyter notebook in this repo for more details!
